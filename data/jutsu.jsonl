If it's found that a policy restricts something that the reason the policy was created didn't intend to restrict, then the policy should be changed.\nThis is the policy for the naming of Naruto articles, characters, places, skills, and techniques.\nContents\n1\nGeneral notes\n1.1\nR\u014dmaji\n1.2\nItalics and Macrons\n2\nChoice of Title\n3\nCharacters\n4\nTerms\nGeneral notes\nThere are some important notes in the naming policy that apply to all categories of names rather than just a specific group.\nR\u014dmaji\nNarutopedia uses\nRevised Hepburn\nfor the romanization of\nkanji\n, like Wikipedia does (to some extent; They have their own tweaks to that system but it's primarily Revised Hepburn).\nThe primary point here is that fandubs and scanlations commonly use\nW\u0101puro r\u014dmaji\n. In addition to that the net has a bad habit of spreading bad translations around enough that people begin to believe they are the official only way to write something. So the net is a bad place to hunt down the proper r\u014dmaji to use for a character's name.\nThe most relevant point here is the difference in treatment of long vowels. In W\u0101puro the long o and u vowels are written using an extra u, so long o would be ou and long u would be uu. However in Revised Hepburn they are represented using macrons, long o being \u014d and long u being \u016b. This means that some names like Ch\u014dji, Hy\u016bga, and J\u016bgo are mistakenly entered into the wiki as Chouji, Hyuuga, and Juugo by newer editors.\nFor the most part if you see a uu, or ou used on the wiki it's a mistake that can be cleaned up. Read the rest of the policy to understand what form of the name you should clean that up to.\nItalics and\nMacrons\nOn the wiki we use\nitalics\nin some locations to indicate that the written form of a term we are using is in Japanese (commonly r\u014dmaji) rather than English. And we also use the macrons inside of r\u014dmaji to give a pronunciation guide to the reader. However for ease of editing we only require these in certain locations, as it would be a strain to write articles and reformat them when names change if we were to use the stylization everywhere.\nBasically, we use italics and macrons in any unique location, ie: one that isn't repeated and bears some significance to the reader. Basically it boils down to:\nMacrons are not used in the English forms of words (The English translation Hyuga uses no macrons, but the r\u014dmaji Hy\u016bga does use macrons)\nMacrons and Italics are used inside of the {{\ntranslation\n}} template.\nThe translation template is primarily only used at the top of the article on a topic. In that location the primary name in the first parameter is normally\nbolded\n.\nThe third parameter to the translation template (the r\u014dmaji parameter) already contains code to italicise the r\u014dmaji so 's aren't needed there, but if you are using r\u014dmaji in the main parameter 's are needed to italicise it.\nMacrons are used in the r\u014dmaji parameter for infoboxes. However italics are not since the infobox adds those automatically.\nHowever macrons and italics are not used in the repeat occurrences of names inside of articles or links.\nChoice of Title\nCertain topics are known by more than one name within the series, such as\n\"Team 7\" and \"Team Kakashi\"\nor\n\"Nine-Tails\" and \"Kurama\"\n. Within the text of articles, editors can refer to the topic using whichever name they feel is appropriate; for example, using \"\nFourth Hokage\n\" within the context of his leadership role and \"\nMinato Namikaze\n\" within the context of his personal life.\nBut an article can only have one title. So, when there is more than one name, the most\nofficial\nname should be used, even if an alias or different descriptor is more common. Of the three previous examples, article titles should be \"Team 7\", \"Kurama\", and \"Minato Namikaze\". The other names (\"Team Kakashi\", \"Nine-Tails\", and \"Fourth Hokage\") remain useful and should exist as redirects.\nCharacters\nFor reference the following paragraphs will refer to certain terms:\nPrimary name\nThe name primarily used for a character. This name is used as the page title for that character, listed in bold in the first parameter in the {{\ntranslation\n}} template used at the start of that character's page, inside the name parameter (header) of the infobox, and is also used throughout the wiki to refer to the character.\nPrimary names generally follow the Japanese databooks, except for cases that go against the Revised Hepburn romanization:\n(\nKiller B\nnot\nKiller Bee\n)\n(\nJ\u016bgo\nnot\nJyuugo\n)\nDifferences in the English dub shall be reflected in the character's infobox.\nContrary to the Japanese\nlast name\n-\nfirst name\nconvention, the wiki uses\nfirst name\n-\nlast name\n, except for the Japanese and romanizaton in the translation template.\n(\nKushina Uzumaki\nnot\nUzumaki Kushina\n)\n(\nKushina Uzumaki\n(\n\u3046\u305a\u307e\u304d\u30af\u30b7\u30ca\n,\nUzumaki Kushina\n)\nnot\nKushina Uzumaki\n(\n\u30af\u30b7\u30ca\u3046\u305a\u307e\u304d\n,\nKushina Uzumaki\n))\nTerms\nThe Narutopedia's default practice is to translate all terms into their literal English meaning. But there are several exceptions to this practice where the wiki prefers to not translate a term. Many of these terms are listed below. This list is neither definitive nor authoritative, and more often than not editors should simply use their best judgment.\nJapanese terms that are already familiar to the average English speaker should not be translated. Such terms include but are not limited to\nShinobi\n,\nShuriken\n, and\nYin\n/\nYang\n.\nTerms inspired by Japanese mythology should not be translated. Such terms include but are not limited to\nShinigami\n,\nTsukuyomi\n, and\nYasaka Magatama\n.\nThis can also be extended to terms based on Japanese culture or idioms whose significance would be lost if translated into English. Such terms include but are not limited to\nShinra Tensei\n,\nYosaku Cut\n, and\nBenihisago\n.\nVillage\nnames are not translated. For ease of reading, the \"\nno Sato\n\" (\u306e\u91cc) part of the name is omitted.\nJutsu\nclassifications are not translated (\nninjutsu\n,\ntaijutsu\n,\ngenjutsu\n). This does not apply to jutsu\ntypes\n(\nchakra absorption techniques\n,\nclone techniques\n,\nreincarnation ninjutsu\n).\nNinja ranks\n, including the titles of the specific\nKage\n, are not translated. This does not apply to other ninja categorizations (\nmissing-nin\n,\nhunter-nin\n,\nmedical-nin\n).\nTerms that, within the\nNaruto\nuniverse, are rare or unique should not be translated. Such terms include:\nThe various\nd\u014djutsu\n, specifically in reference to the actual eye.\nThe swords wielded by the\nSeven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist\n.\nThe\npuppets\ncreated by\nSasori\n.\nThe insects used by members of the\nAburame clan\n.\nTerms that are more familiar to the fandom when not translated should not be translated. These terms are:\nAkatsuki\nAnbu\nChidori\nHebi\n/\nTaka\nJinch\u016briki\nKara\nNind\u014d\nNinken\nNinsh\u016b\nRasengan\nRasenshuriken\nSannin\nTenketsu", "source_url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Narutopedia:Naming_policy"}

Because of the extensive number of hand seals and different combinations, there are thousands of potential jutsu to be discovered.\nContents\n1\nOrigins\n2\nThe Basics\n2.1\nRanks\n3\nMain Jutsu Types\n3.1\nNinjutsu\n3.2\nGenjutsu\n3.3\nTaijutsu\n4\nSub Jutsu Types\n4.1\nBarrier Ninjutsu\n4.2\nBukijutsu\n4.3\nChakra Absorption Techniques\n4.4\nChakra Flow\n4.5\nClone Techniques\n4.6\nCooperation Ninjutsu\n4.7\nF\u016binjutsu\n4.8\nGelel Techniques\n4.9\nHiden\n4.10\nJuinjutsu\n4.11\nJujutsu\n4.12\nKenjutsu\n4.13\nKinjutsu\n4.14\nMedical Ninjutsu\n4.15\nNinsh\u016b\n4.16\nNintaijutsu\n4.17\nRegeneration Techniques\n4.18\nReincarnation Ninjutsu\n4.19\nScientific Ninja Tool Techniques\n4.20\nSenjutsu\n4.21\nShinjutsu\n4.22\nShurikenjutsu\n4.23\nSpace\u2013Time Ninjutsu\n5\nBlood Limit Types\n5.1\nKekkei Genkai\n5.2\nKekkei T\u014dta\n5.3\nKekkei M\u014dra\n5.4\nD\u014djutsu\n6", "source_url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Jutsu"}

If it's found that a policy restricts something that the reason the policy was created didn't intend to restrict, then the policy should be changed.\nThis is the policy for talkpages.\nTalkpage Discussions\nPlease note the following regarding article talkpages:\nTalkpages are not for asking random questions about Naruto. These messages will be removed, as article talkpages are designed for discussing ways to improve the article itself.\nIf you want to ask a question about Naruto, please post a thread in the\nNaruto Discussions\nforum.\nIf you want to discuss how to improve the wiki as a whole, please post in the\nWiki Discussions\nforum.\nWhen creating a discussion on a subject that already has an article, use the articles talkpage. If the subject applies to multiple articles please navigate to a page that applies to both. This is done to prevent duplicate discussions.\nDo not revive dead discussions in order to make a point about something revealed long after the discussion stopped, if it is necessary to continue further discussion then start a new topic.\nIf a discussion on a talkpage is particularly active, it is recommended that the discussion be moved to a forum thread: this is because edit conflicts will make it impossible for an editor to actually contribute since, by the time they have typed out a message or at least tried to add their message during a conflict, they still won't be able to post if several other edits have been made in the time spent trying to add a message.\nUser Talkpages\nUser talkpages belong to the community, they are\nnot\nthe property of the user. The talkpage is a place for other users to give the user messages, and ask questions and communicate when they have done something in conflict with what they have been doing and try to settle a small issue. For this reason a number of restrictions are placed on what you can do to your own talkpage:\nDo not remove or edit old\u00a0messages, the talkpage is the community's way of viewing the history of messages sent to you, this is an open public community where entire histories should be viewable.\nIf your talkpage is getting large or you want to clean up old messages, you are still free to\narchive\nthe old ones. You may only archive resolved discussions and discussions older than 3 months.\nDo not put up notices telling other users not to use your talkpage, or do other actions that hinder users' abilities to send messages to you.\nMessages can be removed from the talkpage if they are\nWikia TOU\nviolations, such as vulgar comments just used for unreasonable harrassment of the user.\nThis is the ONLY acceptable reason for removing messages from a user talkpage.\nTalkpages are not userpages. Content that is added by users that is akin to content that belongs on a userpage may be removed.", "source_url": "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Narutopedia:Talkpage_policy"}
